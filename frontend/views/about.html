			<h2>Quick Start</h2>
			<p>There are two main entry points: via Genres and Direct Search.</p>

			<h3>Genres hierarchy</h3>
			<p>Open <a href="/genres">Genres</a> section, find your favorite musical
				genre in the list, then click <kbd>Learn More</kbd> button.
				Proceed studying its subgenres, artists in the genre, or listen audio samples.</p>
			<p class="small">Tip: <span class="text-muted">Many genres have their sub-genres as well
					as parent genres.</span></p>

			<h3>Direct Search</h3>
			<p>Type any name in the search field below the site title, e.g.: <i>Deep Purple</i>.
				In the drop-down list next to the search field select what are you searching for:
				<i>Artist</i>, <i>Album</i> or <i>Track</i>. Click <kbd>Go</kbd> button.
				After a while you will be redirected to <strong>Search Results</strong> page.
				The best matches will usually be at the top.
			</p>
			<p class="small">Tip: <span class="text-muted">if you do not remember exact name, type its part.
					The search engine will do its best to find what you are looking for.</span>
